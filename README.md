# neuron_detection
The general goal of this project is the development of a new image-based system for automatic neuron tracking using AI. The system will allow for the identification and tracking neurons' movement patterns and neurites characteristics during their development in culture and the eventual modification of those patterns in the presence of neurotoxins.

Positive and negative images of neuron cultures to detect and track them.

This project has been made by around 20.000 positive and 60.000 negative samples. These samples were obtained from 292 different microscopic photographs.
